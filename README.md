as per the discussion topic that professor bloomberg introduced regarding ai assisted programming, i thought it would be interesting to look a little more into that. linked above is an article that details:
- how ai helps programmers
- can ai do coding?
- can ai systems take programmer's place?

currently ai can be used for various parts of programming, such as computer assisted coding, bugfixing, etc. although at this moment ai systems cannot take the place of programmers, it is definitely a possibility in the future with advancing technologies. current ai is not refined, complex, or developed enough to replace real human beings in terms of coding; however, it is still developing at a fast pace. our careers are still secured for the foreseeable future.

^ also an interesting paper evaluating the performance of computer assisted coding (CDC).

Fascinating article on the usage of AI in programming and whether AI can solely automate coding. It is exciting to think about all the possibilities and applications for when this technology is further developed.
